# civilization-level
#Introduction:
This Python notebook explores the relationship between the year and energy output to gain insights into the progress of civilization. By employing regression techniques, we aim to analyze historical data and examine the potential trends in energy production over time. Regression analysis enables us to identify patterns, estimate future energy outputs, and evaluate our current civilization level based on the Kardashev scale.

#Dataset:
We begin by gathering a dataset that contains historical records of energy outputs across different years. The dataset may include measurements from various sources such as global energy statistics, national reports, or scientific publications. Each data entry should consist of a year and its corresponding energy output in gigawatts (GW).

#Data Preprocessing:
The dataset requires preprocessing to ensure its quality and compatibility with regression analysis. This stage involves handling missing values, removing outliers if necessary, and transforming the data into a suitable format for regression modeling. Additionally, any necessary feature engineering or data transformations will be performed to enhance the accuracy of the regression models.

#Regression Modeling:
Several regression techniques will be implemented to capture the relationship between the year and energy output. The choice of regression models may include linear regression, polynomial regression, or other non-linear regression methods depending on the characteristics of the dataset and the expected nature of the relationship.
